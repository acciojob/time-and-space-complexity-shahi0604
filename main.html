    <h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity describes how efficiently an algorithm runs as the size of the input increases, and an efficient algorithm minimizes the time required to produce the result.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> explains the amount of memory an algorithm needs during execution, and it is commonly represented using notations such as O(n) to indicate linear space usage.
